// Adaptive linear predictor: replaces each element of the state vector with a
// prediction of itself `horizon` samples in the future, so a downstream
// controller acts on where the error is GOING to be instead of where it was
// one loop-delay ago. Set horizon to the total command->error latency in
// samples and the predictable part of the disturbance (vibration lines,
// resonant humps -- anything with autocorrelation longer than the delay) is
// corrected as if the delay weren't there; the unpredictable white part is
// passed through untouched (the predictor's least-squares solution learns to
// ignore it). Measured on the FSM loop 2026-07-10: the closed-loop error is
// ~50% predictable at the 2 ms loop delay, so the ceiling is ~2x.
//
// Each element gets an order-p AR model of the signal, predicting s(t+k) from
// [s(t) ... s(t-p+1)], with the weights adapted online by NLMS. (True
// RLS/Kalman weight estimation was tried first and is the natural fit on
// paper, but with exponential forgetting on a narrowband signal its
// covariance grows without bound in the unexcited directions -- classic
// covariance wind-up; it diverged within seconds on recorded loop data.
// NLMS is the robust stochastic approximation of the same estimator, costs
// O(order) per element, and reached the ideal block-least-squares prediction
// bound on the same data with mu ~= 0.02-0.05.)
//
// The handover is ramped: output = a*prediction + (1-a)*input with `a`
// rising linearly from 0 to `gain` over `ramp` seconds once training starts.
// Weights start at zero, so an instant handover would feed the controller a
// near-zero error signal (loop effectively open) until the model converges;
// the ramp keeps the loop closed on the raw error while the predictor earns
// its authority.
//
// Put it after the sensor (center_of_mass) and any logging sink, before
// anyloop:pid. It trains continuously on its own input, so it keeps tracking
// the closed-loop statistics as the loop and environment change.
