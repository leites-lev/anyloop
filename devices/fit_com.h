// The beam is modelled as CIRCULAR: one sigma, shared by both axes. Splitting
// it into sigma_y/sigma_x means a real elliptical fit -- separate decay
// constants through the rowwalk recurrences and a second sigma column in the

// A rolling-shutter frame does not have "a" beam position: every row is
// captured at a different instant, so a frame in which the beam moves is
// sheared, and any single position extracted from it is ill-defined. Rather
// than measure one position and then try to undo the shear afterwards (which
// is what anyloop:wfs_com's row regression attempts, from 2-3 row-group means
// -- far too few points to condition a slope), this device puts the motion
// INSIDE the model and fits it directly:
//
//   I(row,col) = bg + amp * exp(-[(row-y(row))^2 + (col-x(row))^2] / 2 sigma^2)
//     y(row) = y0 + slope_y * (row - ref_row)
//     x(row) = x0 + slope_x * (row - ref_row)
//
// Seven parameters against every pixel in the window -- overdetermined by
// orders of magnitude, where the row-group regression had two parameters from
// three points. Shear stops being a defect to be detected and rejected, and
// becomes the signal that identifies the slope. Nothing is ever discarded for
// moving, so there is no shear gate, and therefore none of the
// velocity-correlated frame dropout that a shear gate necessarily produces (a
// shear threshold is a velocity threshold, so it preferentially drops frames
// at the fast part of every oscillation and keeps the turning points).
