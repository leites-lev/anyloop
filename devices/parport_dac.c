// Parallel-port-driven TI DAC81404 (quad 16-bit, high-voltage output) --
// the fast replacement for the DAQC2/BRIDGEplate serial DAC path.
//
// The transport is a StarTech PEX1P2 (ASIX AX99100) PCIe parallel card. Its
// registers are reachable through a *memory* BAR, so a pin change is a plain
// store to mapped memory (~100-300 ns, posted) instead of an outb (~1-2 us,
// non-posted) or a serial round-trip (~500-700 us on the BRIDGEplate).
//
// Two ways to get from the DB25 to the DAC, selected by `link`:
//
//   link="spi" (default) -- the DB25 data pins ARE the SPI bus: D0=SCLK,
//     D1=SDIN, D2=SYNC by default (all configurable), GND on 18-25. SYNC and
//     LDAC are both active-low pins, per TI's own naming (SLASEH2A pin table
//     -- no "Z" suffix; see the polarity note below). We bit-bang the 24-bit
//     frames ourselves: 2 stores per bit plus the frame
//     channel update (~123 ns per store, effective SCLK ~3.75 MHz). That is
//     far under every SCLK ceiling the part specifies: 50 MHz for writes at
//     IOVDD 2.7-5.5 V (SLASEH2A 7.7), but only 35 MHz for reads with FSDO=1
//     and 20 MHz with FSDO=0 (7.10, 7.11) -- worth knowing because `verify`
//     reads. Nothing but wires between the card and the BP-DAC81404EVM, so
//     this works today -- CONFIRMED 2026-07-29: the DAC drives real voltage
//     out of DAC_VOUT_A, tracking the commanded value (see DAC POWER-UP
//     below; contrib/conf_parport_dac_2v.json parks channel 0 at `offset`).
//
//   link="pico" -- the DB25 carries a byte-parallel handshake to an
//     RP2040/RP2350 whose PIO does the SPI at 50 MHz. Four stores per sample
//     (~0.6 us): low byte, clock high, high byte, clock low; the channel
//     number rides on spare control lines. About 12x less time spent inside
//     the loop's critical section, and the Pico owns the DAC's init sequence
//     and LDAC timing. Requires the bridge firmware to exist.
//
// LEVELS: MEASURED 2026-07-27 on this card, and the two pin groups DIFFER.
// Data pins D0-D7 swing to 3.3 V unbuffered -- safe straight into the EVM
// (IOVDD 3.3 V) or a Pico. But the CONTROL pins (1, 14, 16, 17) swing to
// 4.94 V: they are buffered to IEEE-1284 levels, which exceeds the DAC's
// absolute maximum and would kill an RP2040/RP2350 GPIO. So the spi link
// (data pins only) needs no level shifting, while the pico link -- whose
// clock and channel-select lines sit on control pins -- DOES, as would a
// hardware LDAC line on a control pin. Series resistors of 33-100 ohm on SCLK
// and leads under ~20 cm keep the bit-bang edges clean.
//
// PINOUT: D0-D7 are DB25 pins 2-9, ground is 18-25. DB25 pin 1 is /STROBE, a
// CONTROL line, not D0. Control lines are pins 1 (STROBE), 14 (AUTOFD), 16
// (INIT), 17 (SELECT); all but INIT are inverted between register bit and pin,
// which pp_write_ctrl() folds in so callers work in pin polarity.
// As built: D0=SCLK, D1=SDIN, D2=SYNC -- i.e. the pin_sclk/pin_sdin/pin_sync
// defaults of 0/1/2, so no pin overrides belong in the config. The breakout's
// screw terminals wear plastic covers; pull one to land or meter a wire and
// put it back, since the 4.94 V control pins sit right beside the 3.3 V data
// pins that run to the DAC.
//
// POLARITY: the DAC's frame-bracket pin is SYNC and its load-strobe pin is
// LDAC, both active-low -- confirmed 2026-07-28 against a locally saved copy
// of SLASEH2A (dac81404.pdf, opened with pdftotext -- TI's own pin table
// literally reads "SDO SCLK SDIN SYNC LDAC GND IOVDD CLR", no "Z" anywhere).
// This file briefly called them SYNCZ/LDACZ, reasoning from the BP-DAC81404
// EVM's *schematic* net name `DAC_SYNCZ` (SLAU825) -- that's the EVM board
// designer's own active-low notation for the net, not the chip's pin name,
// and the datasheet is the authority for what the pin is actually called.
// The bit-bang logic was never affected either way (SYNC is driven low to
// open a frame and high to close it, see spi_frame() below); only the name
// wobbled.
//
// The LDAC PIN is never driven by this code at all (it isn't even wired --
// see UNUSED PINS below). What decides when an output moves is SYNCCONFIG:
//
//   DACx-SYNC-EN clear = ASYNCHRONOUS (default). "A DAC data register write
//     results in an immediate update of the DAC active register and DAC
//     output on a SYNC rising edge" (SLASEH2A 8.3.3.1.2). Channels written
//     in the same iteration therefore step one frame apart, ~6.4 us on the
//     spi link.
//   DACx-SYNC-EN set = SYNCHRONOUS, selected by `sync_update`. The DACx
//     write only loads the channel's buffer register; the output moves on a
//     trigger, "generated either through the SOFT-LDAC bit or by the LDAC
//     pin" (8.3.3.1.1). Since the pin is unwired we use the bit: proc()
//     loads every channel, then issues ONE TRIGGER write with SOFT-LDAC
//     (bit 4, table 8-17), and all of them step together on that frame's
//     SYNC rising edge.
//
// dac_configure() writes SYNCCONFIG explicitly either way rather than trust
// the reset default -- with reset_at_init=false against a device a previous
// process left in the other mode, that write is the only thing standing
// between you and outputs that accept every write and never move, which is a
// miserable thing to debug from the outside.
//
// UNUSED PINS: LDAC (13), CLR (16) and RST (32) are driven by nothing here,
// and AS BUILT (2026-07-29) nothing from the DB25 is wired to them at all --
// the EVM holds all three at 3.3 V through its own 10k pull-ups, with J2
// REMOVED so LDAC is not pulled to ground. (EVM net names LDACZ/CLRZ/RSTZ;
// the chip pin names drop the "Z", see POLARITY above.) That is the wanted
// state: SLASEH2A's pin table asks for it outright for LDAC and CLR
// ("Connect to IOVDD if unused") and says nothing of the sort for RST, but
// all three are active-low inputs with no documented INTERNAL pull-up, so
// those external 10k are what makes "unused" mean "inactive" rather than
// "floating". Each fails differently if one is dragged low:
//   LDAC -- grounding it (the EVM's J2 1-2 default) is harmless only as long
//     as every channel stays in asynchronous mode. J2 stays off, and with
//     `sync_update` that is a REQUIREMENT, not a preference: channels in
//     synchronous mode "are updated simultaneously when the LDAC pin is low"
//     (pin table), so a grounded LDAC holds the transfer permanently open
//     and every buffer write reaches the output the moment it lands --
//     silently turning synchronous mode back into asynchronous, with the
//     simultaneity you asked for quietly gone.
//   CLR  -- a low "forces all DAC channels to clear the contents of their
//     buffer and active registers to the clear code regardless of their
//     synchronization setting" (8.3.3.3): zero code unipolar, midscale
//     bipolar, all four channels. With skip_unchanged set this code would not
//     notice, since it only re-sends a channel whose computed code CHANGES.
//   RST  -- worst of the three. tRSTW is 20 ns, and a POR "causes all
//     registers to initialize to default values" (8.3.5): DEV-PWDWN set,
//     reference off, channels powered down and clamped to ground, ranges back
//     to 0-5 V, FSDO back to 0, CRC-EN off. dac_configure() runs once in init
//     and nothing re-checks it, so every frame after that is silently ignored
//     until anyloop restarts. Nothing here needs a hardware reset line
//     anyway: reset_at_init issues a SOFT-RESET through TRIGGER, which 8.3.5
//     defines as the same POR event. 11.1 backs the tie-off up -- "the RST
//     and FAULT signals are static lines".
// Meter all three at ~IOVDD (3.3 V) against ground after any rework that
// disturbs J2/J3 or the pull-up network. On the current build they read there
// with no jumpers fitted and no wires attached.
//
// ROOT / DRIVER: the mmio backend needs CAP_SYS_RAWIO (run as root) and needs
// parport_pc off the device, which `unbind` does by default (rebind after with
// `echo 0000:05:00.2 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/parport_pc/bind`). It ALSO needs
// kernel lockdown off: with Secure Boot ON the machine boots lockdown
// "integrity", which refuses to mmap a PCI BAR ("Lockdown: direct PCI access
// is restricted" in dmesg) and equally refuses ioperm/outb, leaving no
// user-space fast path at all. Check with
// `cat /sys/kernel/security/lockdown` -- the BRACKETED word is the active mode
// and must read "[none]" (Secure Boot was disabled 2026-07-27 to get there).
//
// backend="ppdev" works regardless: same wiring, same frames, but every edge
// becomes an ioctl. MEASURED here at ~4 us per edge, i.e. ~200 us per 24-bit
// frame (~4.9 k frames/s), so a two-channel update costs ~0.4 ms -- as slow as
// the BRIDGEplate it replaces. Use it to check wiring and frames, not to close
// a loop. Nothing here touches interrupts or DMA.
//
// Params (transport):
//   backend   -- "mmio" (default) or "ppdev"
//   pci       -- PCI slot of the parallel function (default "0000:05:00.2");
//                check with `lspci -d 125b: -nn`
//   bar       -- memory BAR index holding the SPP registers (default 2)
//   data_offset, status_offset, ctrl_offset -- register offsets inside `bar`
//                (defaults 0x280, 0x284, 0x288). The AX99100 does NOT use the
//                byte-packed ISA layout: the block is dword-spaced at +0x280,
//                measured on this card 2026-07-27
//   ecr_bar   -- memory BAR holding the ECP ECR (default 2 = same BAR as the
//                other registers, -1 to skip). The ECR is forced to SPP/
//                compatibility mode at init so the data pins are plain outputs
//   ecr_offset -- ECR offset inside ecr_bar (default 0x2a8)
//   ecr_value -- what to write there (default 0x14: SPP, interrupts off)
//   unbind    -- unbind parport_pc from `pci` before mapping (default true)
//   probe     -- read the data register back at init and check it holds what
//                we wrote, which catches a wrong `bar` (default true)
//   port      -- ppdev node (default "/dev/parport0")
//
// Params (link):
//   link      -- "spi" (default) or "pico"
//   sclk_bit, sdin_bit, sync_bit -- data pins carrying the SPI signals in
//                spi link (defaults 0, 1, 2 = DB25 pins 2, 3, 4)
//   clk_ctrl_bit -- control line clocking bytes into the bridge in pico link:
//                0=STROBE(pin 1) 1=AUTOFD(14) 2=INIT(16) 3=SELECT(17)
//                (default 0)
//   chan_ctrl_shift -- first control line carrying the channel number in pico
//                link; two lines are used (default 1, i.e. AUTOFD+INIT)
//   delay_ns  -- extra dwell after each edge, nanoseconds (default 0). The
//                store latency alone (~123 ns) is an order of magnitude past
//                the DAC's tSDIS/tSDIH of 10 ns at IOVDD 2.7-5.5 V (20 ns
//                below that) -- SLASEH2A 7.6, 7.7 -- so raise this only if
//                the wiring is long or unterminated
//   verify    -- spi link only; after each write -- including the one-shot
//                SPICONFIG/GENCONFIG/SYNCCONFIG/DACRANGE/DACPWDWN init
//                sequence in dac_configure(), not just per-channel writes --
//                check over SDO/ACK (DB25 pin 10 -> status register) that it
//                landed, and warn if it didn't (default false).
//                HOW MUCH gets checked depends on the register, because half
//                the DAC81404's map is write-only (SLASEH2A table 8-7 TYPE
//                column). SPICONFIG/GENCONFIG/SYNCCONFIG/DACPWDWN are R/W, so
//                the value itself is read back and compared. DACRANGE and
//                DACA-D are typed plain W: nothing can be read back from
//                them, and a read command aimed at one proves nothing, so
//                what gets checked is the R/W+address echo the NEXT cycle
//                carries (table 8-3). Turning `crc` on upgrades even those to
//                a full data check, because a CRC-mode echo carries the
//                previous cycle's data as well (table 8-5). The logs say
//                which of the two happened ("confirmed by ... readback" vs.
//                "acknowledged by ... (R/W+address echo)").
//                Cost: one or two extra frames per write, PLUS a non-posted
//                PCIe status read on every bit of the one frame whose answer
//                is used -- measured 2026-07-28: verified writes run roughly
//                two orders of magnitude slower than the ~6 us unverified
//                figure above (order 0.1-0.3 ms), because pp_read_status() is
//                a non-posted read (the CPU waits for a completion
//                round-trip) where every other operation in this file is a
//                posted, fire-and-forget write. This is inherent to
//                reading anything back over this transport, not a bug to
//                chase further -- verify is a bring-up/diagnostic tool,
//                not something to leave on across a real closed loop.
//                dac_configure() also forces SPICONFIG.FSDO=1, which is
//                REQUIRED, not cosmetic: SCLK idles high, so the first edge
//                inside a cycle is a falling one, and only "SDO updates on
//                SCLK falling edges" (SLASEH2A 8.6.4) lines the 24 samples up
//                with the 24 output bits. With the reset default FSDO=0 every
//                sample would sit one bit position early. One thing is still
//                NOT confirmed: which AX99100 status register bit ACK
//                actually lands on for THIS card (that's not in the DAC's
//                datasheet at all -- it would need the AX99100 datasheet or a
//                bench measurement). See dac_write_and_verify()'s echo check,
//                which exists specifically to catch that rather than silently
//                trusting misaligned data.
//   ack_status_bit -- status-register bit carrying SDO (default 6, the
//                standard SPP ACK bit position; unverified on this card,
//                see `verify` above)
//   crc       -- spi link only; use 32-bit frames with an appended CRC-8
//                (SLASEH2A 8.5.3, polynomial x8+x2+x+1) instead of plain
//                24-bit ones, and turn on SPICONFIG.CRC-EN so the device
//                rejects (instead of silently accepting) a write whose CRC
//                doesn't check out (default false). Independent of
//                `verify`: this protects every write, not just ones being
//                read back -- and when `verify` IS on it strictly improves
//                it, since a CRC-mode echo carries the previous cycle's data
//                (table 8-5), which is the only way to confirm a write to a
//                write-only register like DACx. crc8_atm() uses initial
//                remainder 0x00, MSB first, no reflection and no XOR-out;
//                8.5.3's "if no error exists, the CRC remainder is zero"
//                pins down everything there except bit order. Requires
//                reset_at_init (default true); see dac_configure()'s
//                comment on why.
//
// Params (outputs -- same meaning as piplate_bridge, so configs port over):
//   channel   -- DAC channel(s), 0=DACA 1=DACB 2=DACC 3=DACD, scalar or array
//   index     -- pipeline vector element(s) to command (default 0)
//   scale     -- volts per pipeline unit (default 1.0)
//   offset    -- volts at zero command (default 0.0)
//   range     -- output range per channel, scalar or array (default "0-10"):

//   start_delay -- seconds to hold a channel at `offset` before letting the
//                pipeline command through (default 0). Give the upstream pid
//                a matching start_delay, or its integrator winds up during
//                the hold
//   skip_unchanged -- only send a channel when its 16-bit code changes
//                (default false). The DAC holds its register, so this is safe
//                here -- unlike the BRIDGEplate there is no droop argument --
//                but it costs nothing to leave off
//   sync_update -- put every driven channel in synchronous mode so they all
//                step together (default false, i.e. asynchronous). Each DACx
//                write only loads that channel's buffer register, and one
//                SOFT-LDAC per iteration moves all of them at once. Costs one
//                extra frame per iteration (~6.4 us on the spi link) and
//                delays the first channel's motion until the last one has
//                been written; in exchange the channels stop stepping ~6.4 us
//                apart. Worth it when two channels drive one physical axis
//                (an X/Y mirror, a coarse/fine pair) and the skew between
//                them is a real disturbance; pointless for one channel, and
//                rejected on the pico link. spi link only
//   reset_at_init -- issue a DAC soft reset before configuring (default true;
//                spi link only)
//
// The DAC81404 wakes up device-wide powered down (SPICONFIG.DEV-PWDWN) with
// its reference and all four output amplifiers powered down too, so in spi
// link init writes SPICONFIG (device active), GENCONFIG (reference on),
// SYNCCONFIG (asynchronous update), DACRANGE (the configured ranges) and
// DACPWDWN (the configured channels on, the rest left clamped to ground
// through their internal 10 kohm) before parking every channel at its
// `offset`. Codes are MSB-aligned straight binary across the selected range,
// divided into 2^16 steps rather than 2^16 - 1: SLASEH2A equations 1 and 2
// make full-scale code 0xFFFF one LSB SHORT of the nominal top of the range
// (9.99985 V on the 0-10 V range), and volts_to_code() scales accordingly.
//
// Output updates are spaced at least SLASEH2A's tDACWAIT (2.4 us) apart --
// see dac_update_wait(). A bit-banged frame is longer than that anyway, but
// the pico link's ~0.6 us per sample is not.

*
* SDIN is sampled on SCLK falling edges and the cycle is bracketed by SYNC

* that presents the bit with SCLK high, one that drops SCLK. Idle state is
* SYNC high, SCLK high.
*
* When `sample_sdo` is set, we also sample the ACK/SDO status bit on each
* of the 24 falling edges and return the 24 bits shifted in, MSB first.
* Confirmed 2026-07-28 against a local copy of SLASEH2A (Table 8-2, 8-3):
* a read needs a read-command cycle followed by a second cycle to shift the
* answer out on SDO, which carries an echo of the *previous* cycle's
* R/W+address in its top 8 bits and that cycle's requested data in the
* bottom 16 -- hence a verified write is 3 calls (write, read-command, NOP
* to shift the answer out), and only the LAST of those three has anything
* worth sampling; `sample_sdo` lets callers skip the status read on the
* other two, which matters because it is not free: pp_read_status() is a
* non-posted PCIe read (the CPU waits for a completion round-trip), unlike
* the posted writes this file is otherwise built on, and measures roughly
* an order of magnitude slower per access -- sampling on all three frames
* instead of just the one that's used was needlessly tripling that cost.
* SPICONFIG.FSDO is forced to 1 in dac_configure() specifically so "SDO
* updates on SCLK falling edges" (8.6.4) lines up with where this loop
* samples, and that is a requirement here, not a nicety: because the idle
* level of SCLK is high, the first SCLK edge inside a cycle is a FALLING one,
* so the loop's 24 samples line up one-for-one with the 24 falling edges
* (D23 first). With the reset default FSDO=0 -- "SDO updates on SCLK rising
* edges" -- the first rising edge does not arrive until after the first
* falling edge, so every sample would be shifted one position and D0 would
* never be seen at all. That leaves one thing unconfirmed, on purpose not
* papered over: which AX99100 status-register bit ACK physically lands on for
* this card (not in the DAC datasheet at all). dac_write_and_verify()

*
* THE INTERMEDIATE VALUE, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE ZERO. DACRANGE is a resistor
* gain network (SLASEH2A 8.3.2): it takes effect the instant the write lands
* and re-interprets whatever code is already in the active register. There is
* no atomic range+code update, and the buffered path does not help -- DACRANGE
* acts on the ACTIVE register and ignores SYNCCONFIG. So between the two
* writes the output shows one frame (~6.4 us) of something that is neither
* the old voltage nor the new one.
*
* It cannot be made glitch-free, because a single code expresses the same
* voltage in two ranges only where they intersect: solving
* vmin_A + span_A*c = vmin_B + span_B*c gives exactly one such voltage (0 V
* for two bipolar or two unipolar ranges). Away from it there is no bridging
* code, so SOMETHING moves.
*
* What IS controllable is which of the two orders is used, and the two differ
* a lot:
*
*   DACRANGE first: the OLD code is reinterpreted. Widening +-5 -> +-10, a
*     code meaning 4.9 V becomes 9.8 V -- a 2x OVERSHOOT, and in the same
*     direction the command was already heading, which is the worst possible
*     direction to throw a mirror.
*   code first: the NEW code (written while the OLD range is still active)
*     reads as v_target scaled DOWN by the range ratio, so the output dips
*     toward zero and then lands exactly on v_target when DACRANGE follows.
*     An undershoot, and it costs one frame less because no third write is
*     needed.
*
* Rather than hard-code "code first when widening", both candidate
* intermediates are evaluated and the order with the smaller excursion()
* outside [v_current, v_target] is used -- an intermediate that lies BETWEEN
* the two is not a glitch at all, just an early or late arrival. That also
* stays correct for a ladder mixing unipolar and bipolar ranges, where the
* simple widen/narrow rule does not hold.
*
* One case forces the old order: with sync_update, a DACx write only loads the
* buffer register, so it cannot pre-position the ACTIVE register and the
* code-first trick does nothing. */
