/** Unit tests for prbs_test, against a simulated plant of known delay.
*
* A delay measurement is worth exactly as much as its ability to return the
* delay you put in, so that is what these check: a plant with a programmed
* whole-frame delay and a one-pole rise is driven by the device's own PRBS, and
* the reported onset, peak and phase-slope numbers are compared against the
* delay the plant was built with. The awkward cases are covered too -- a plant
* whose gain is negative (the optical path inverts on one axis here), a
* stimulus buried in noise, and a plant that isn't moving at all, which must be
* reported as a failure rather than as a fast loop.
*
* The device counts frames rather than seconds for everything except its
* warmup, so these run at whatever rate the machine manages; a realistic loop
* period is slept anyway, since the ms and Hz figures come from wall clock.
*
* Run: ninja -C build test  (or build/test_prbs_test) */

 * streaks: the PEAK barely moves (+0.013 fr) but the phase slope -- the number
 * this device exists to hand to an fsp delay/delay_frac pair -- reads short,
 * and the correlation drops from 0.865 to 0.836. At 51% dark it is 0.66 frames
 * short at rho 0.73. Short, not long: held samples have a spread of ages, so
 * they decorrelate the response rather than shifting it coherently, and what a
 * decorrelated high-frequency end does to a phase-slope fit is flatten it.
 * (Below ~10% dark the sign is not even stable, for the same reason: at that
 * point it is all decorrelation and no shift.)
 *
 * How far short depends on where [phase_f_lo, phase_f_hi] sits in the spectrum,
 * which moves with the loop rate the machine happens to manage -- 0.09 frames
 * at this harness's rate, 0.24 at a faster one. So the thresholds below check
 * a direction and a floor, not a value.
